## Presentation and History

This repository contains the Infinity Records Website code. Infinity Records is a music record-label that I started few years ago. Last year, I decided to formalize this institution by creating a website showcasing the scope of our resources, our mindset, and our present accomplishements.

## Composition

The application is divided in four parts within a main container. This container is composed by a header (triggering an entering animation when you're loading the home page), a contact form and an informative footer.

The four pages of the application describe :

- A **Home** page, presenting news of the label, and the website content
- **The Label** presentation, where you can learn about who we are and what we do
- **The Artists** presentation, introducing artists we manage and their accomplishments
- A **Merch** section, where you can see our branded clothing

The whole application is available in two languages (English and French) and have a responsive web-mobile version. The application is also a Progressive Web App, so you can even pin the website as an app on your phone.

## Organisation

Based on my previous experiences, I organized this development as an agile team in which I covered several positions:

- as the **Product Owner** : carrying the product vision and conceiving the Product Backlog
- as the **Scrum Master** : setting-up the visual management with an Asana board, and facilitating the development team
- as the main member of the **Development Team** : even though the visual conception was made by my girlfriend who is UI Designer, I developed the whole application on my own : from conception to automated deployment, passing by application engineering.
